This project follows a No Code of Conduct (NCoC) philosophy. We are all human
beings. We should all be capable of getting along well.

# Contributor (No) Code of Conduct

No Code of Conduct was created to allow projects and communities to cooperate
without getting stuck in endless debates on how members should behave. Publicly
shared projects should, by nature, be a welcoming and safe place.

## Overview

Everyone is expected to behave like an adult and therefore be capable of
having adult discussions.

Everyone contributions are accepted regardless of their level of experience,
gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.
It should not be important. It should not be asked. It simply does not matter.

Everyone should be able to freely express their ideas without being offended
by nor offend others.

## Community Members

If by not having a Code of Conduct you feel discriminated against, then it is
hard for anyone to relate to you. There is no intent to discriminate against
anyone. Not *babysitting* the community on this project to make sure they
treat others with respect does not mean we hope you feel unwelcome, or that
you are treated without respect.

Problems, or other situations, should be addressed like in any other platform,
project or discussion forum. There is no reason for the rest of the community
not to listen to what you have to say as long as you do not disrespect them.

This project community may not be warm and helpful, there is nothing wrong
or offensive about it, and you certainly will not be harassed unless you
harass people here. Some projects have small communities and the members of
those communities do most of their work on free/spare time, keep that in mind.

Limiting yourself to participate in projects or communities that only have
Codes of Conduct is limiting yourself as a human being on this marvellous
place called the internet. It is not this community's place to care about
individual feelings. We leave that to the individuals. The internet is a big
place, you should prepare yourself to deal with it.

Every human being should strive to lead by example. This community believes
that there are enough level-headed adults in it to back you up. However, if
someone tells you you are stupid, or wrong. Stop. Think. Does this have
anything to do with your race, region, religion, or anything else not related
to this project? Have you considered, that they are either having a bad day,
are a bad listener, or possibly, you are wrong? If you feel you're not wrong,
please, by all means, reply. This community loves discussion! This community
loves its members. This community believes that if you are a level-headed
adult, you will be treated like one. Other level-headed adults want to hear
from you.

Please do not start a fire where there does not need to be one. Try to be more
tolerant of others and not read into their deep inner views. This community
has said clearly over and over that we do not care who you are, where you come
from, or where you are going. This community values intelligent discussion on
its topic, and that's it.

If someone from this community treats you in an unfair way, feel free to email
that person, and try to work it out. Also email the owners of the community,
and alert them. Just do not make a scene, as that will burden the entire
community with your issue. If it's truly a problem and you are truly an asset
to the community then you will probably get an email back. Sometimes, you will
have to be the bigger person. Say your piece privately, and don't dwell on it.
Remember, this is not the time or place to start these kinds of discussions.
If some other member of this community did this to you, that is *unclassy*,
but there is only so much a moderator and personal discussion can accomplish.
Bringing it to a larger group will be of poor form, and not helpful.

Off topic chatter should be discouraged, but not censored. This community is in
the business of policing people's personal lives. Part of not discriminating
against people, is not discriminating against people. Different people have
different views. If someone said something about you or this community in
another community please use that community mechanisms to properly deal with
that.

## Community Managers

Community managers will lock and ban your way to freedom whenever deemed
necessary. This is unfortunate. Community managers will try no to delete
anything, to avoid being accused of censorship but sometimes they are left
with no other option. Community managers will not engage in futile discussions.
They should really be very brief, vague, and closed off in those discussions.

Community managers and leaders will not be going to tolerate for the community
to be overridden by the mob. If that starts to happen, they will *nuke*,
*delete*, *lock*, *close*, *ban*, and do whatever they have to do to put the
fire out. Those discussions drag on and on and on, and they do not make
communities better.

Community managers are not members of a support group for human emotion. This
is a community that strives to focus around its topics. Anything else takes
away from that.
